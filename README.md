# Movie-Matchmaker

## This project consists of 2 parts: 
## Part 1:
**Web Scraping** and **Data Collection** from a LetterBoxd profile. 


## Part 2: 
**Building a Rating Predictor** based on the scraped data to predict unwatched movies' ratings.

Have you ever recommended a movie to a friend that you really liked and they hated it, or did you dislike the movie they recommended to you? 've been there on both sides and it sucks.
Everyone has their unique taste and even movie that has a high rating from a large audience may not suit your liking sometimes. 
I overcome this issue by utilizing Data Mining, Analysis, and Machine Learning. With this approach, you can have a close estimation on how much you are going to like a movie before watching it.
